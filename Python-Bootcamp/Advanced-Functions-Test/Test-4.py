def concatenate(L1, L2, connector):
    '''
        Use zip and list comprehension to return a list of the same length where each value is the two strings from L1 and L2 concatenated together with connector between them. Look at the example output below:
    '''



concatenate(['A','B'],['a','b'],'-') #['A-a', 'B-b']

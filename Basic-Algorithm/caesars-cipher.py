            One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

            A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' â†” 'N', 'B' â†” 'O' and so on.

            Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

            All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
